# Graphic_auth
 
## Graphical Authentication System Submitted for Smart India Hackathon 2022

The idea is to provide Graphical Authentication Systems for the people who are visually impaired or might have trouble remembering numbers.
With this, they can remember the combination of fruits / vegetables, and accordingly that combination will turn into a strong password which will be sent to the backend.
